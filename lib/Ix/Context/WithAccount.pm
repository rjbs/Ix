# A wrapper around DBIC's txn_do. What this does is:
#
#  * increment our transaction depth
#  * localize our copy of the pending states
#  * Run the transaction
#  * If it succeeds, we copy out the states that actually need changing
#    and ship them up to our outer scope. This ensures that we don't
#    record state changes in internal calls to ix_set if something fails
#    somewhere along the way.
#  * decrement our transaction depth. If depth reaches 0, that means we're
#    at the start of the transaction and we need to commit state changes
#
# This should probably only be used by ix_set() and any calls it makes
# internally that may try to bump state (generally, anything that may lead
# to a nested ix_set).
